        Self-taught programmer currently based in New York City. Proponent of open source softwares and their communities. Over the past several years I have been a steady contributor to the Google Chromium developer tools. The most rewarding part of programming to me, would be the process of using logic to solve difficult problems. I also appreciate the ability to create something new and inspiring. I am open to the idea of relocating.
